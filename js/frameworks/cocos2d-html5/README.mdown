Cocos2d-html5
==================

[Cocos2d-html5][1] is a cross-platform 2D game engine written in JavaScript, based on [Cocos2d-X][2] and licensed under MIT.
It incorporates the same high level api as “Cocos2d JS-binding engine” and compatible with Cocos2d-X.
It currently supports canvas and WebGL renderer.

#### Cocos2d-html5 has evolved to [Cocos Creator][11], new generation of Cocos game engine with a full featured editor and content creation friendly workflow. It supports all major platforms allowing games to be quickly released for the web, iOS, Android, Windows, Mac, and various mini-game platforms. A pure JavaScript-developed engine runtime is available on the web and mini-game platforms for better performance and smaller packages. On other native platforms, C++ is used to implement the underlying framework, providing greater operational efficiency. The latest repository is maintained in here [Engine of Cocos Creator][9].
